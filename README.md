# Farewell

"It's dangerous to go alone! Take this."

A basic POC in rust ðŸ¦€ to download infos of any country referenced by [the french Ministry of Foreign Affairs](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/conseils-aux-voyageurs/) "Conseil aux voyageurs".

As of now (2024/01/03), this will only download the security map in {country_french_name}\_farewell.jpg

## How to run the script

```rust
cargo run colombie
```

This will create a colombie_farewell.jpg file
